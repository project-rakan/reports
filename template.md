# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. this subsection should be higher-level than individual contributions and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it's good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.*
