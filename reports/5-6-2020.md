# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. This subsection should be higher-level than individual contributions and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it's good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.*

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Fully Functioning Runner module with algorithms implemented.
  * Further fleshing out hardcoded implementation tests.
  * Connect Runner to the network queue.
* dev-ops team
  * TODO
* front-end team
  * Final prototype review and feedback
  * General status update

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

## Kyle McCulloch ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * Will need to work with backend to finalize file format
  * Create .idx files for each state
  * Finish JSON pipeline

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * The formats are finalized
  * The JSON pipeline needs a final touch up to fit the front end's spec better.
  * The idx pipelines are finished
  * The idx files /can/ be created for each state, but they havent been processed yet. Blocked on data cleaning, but this is not necessarily a priority
  What worked:
  * The communication this week was great and I was able to finish up most of the work on the output portion of the pipeline

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
 * Work with Norton to set up a one box beta for next week
 * Create api calls for the front end and backend and implement the Queue
 * Finalize the json output, adding the correct map serialization

## Idess Lee ## 

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago):
  * Design and implement the Reader and Runner classes.
  * Ensure the unit tests for the Reader class pass, else, redesign Reader class.
  * Deploy the Rakan Runner on Docker (will need to consult with DevOps team).

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * What I did:
    * Implemented Reader class. Fixed related bugs.
    * Developed a prototype for Runner class (i.e. built method signatures, no implementation).
  * What worked:
    * Reading and loading a graph with the iowa.idx file given by the DevOps team appears successful. Nodes investigated appear as they should with expected fields.
  * What I learned:
    * Redesigning classes is a pain in the neck. Luckily, since our spec sheet was super clear from day 1, I didn't have much trouble altering pieces here and there.
      * For example, switching some argument types from C++ references to pointers.
  * Where I had trouble:
    * Endianness got the best of me. I was stumpped over a bug when using the htonl() library function because I forgot about endianness.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Implement Runner class fully.
  * Deploy the Rakan Runner on Docker (will need to consult with DevOps team).
  * Connect Runner to the Queue.

## William Castro ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

	* Develop header and .cc files for graph, nodes, and runner classes. Complete basic implementation to begin to write fully fleshed tests.
	* Finish the testsuite executable to run all tests with ease.
	* Possibly learn CMake? Depending on backend direction going further into the week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
	* Worked on Runner module, as well as helped figuring out how to get parts of the Reader module fully functioning.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
	* Upon the finishing of the runner module by tomorrow, the backend team will develop the test suite and also begin to look at code design to begin to improve our implemetation. 

## Colin Topper ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week: This week I will write providers for the APIs defined last week. Additionally I will setup the redux store so that the data from the API responses can be propogated to the UI.

* I implemented mock providers for all of the contracts defined so far. Additionally I wrote unit tests for these providers and connected them to the redux store. This involved setting up a redux store from scratch which was painful as always but is now complete (and Type safe!). There were a few API contract updates aswell but no major overhauls.

* This week I am writting a provider for the google maps API. This includes setting up billing and managing an API key. By the end of this week we should be able to draw a map of Iowa on the screen complete with precincts and districts.
