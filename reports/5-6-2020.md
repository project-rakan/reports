# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago).
  * Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet
  * Notable team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready (due 5/1)

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * Front-end team continued to work on their prototype, no complaints of trouble so far.
  * Dev-ops team attempted to solve multi-polygon issues from previous week and finalized idx, json pipelines.
  * Back-end team completed most of their implementations and have successfully read the iowa.idx file to Graph.
  * No team has reported any roadblocks.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Now urgent team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready (still due 5/1)

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Fully Functioning Runner module with algorithms implemented.
  * Further fleshing out hardcoded implementation tests.
  * Connect Runner to the network queue.
* dev-ops team
  * TODO
* front-end team
  * Final prototype review and feedback
  * General status update

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

* DISCONNECTED POLYGONS ISSUE RESOLVED!!!
* Visualization tool
* Deployment script for distribution-db

## Kyle McCulloch ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * Will need to work with backend to finalize file format
  * Create .idx files for each state
  * Finish JSON pipeline

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * The formats are finalized
  * The JSON pipeline needs a final touch up to fit the front end's spec better.
  * The idx pipelines are finished
  * The idx files /can/ be created for each state, but they haven't been processed yet. Blocked on data cleaning, but this is not necessarily a priority
  What worked:
  * The communication this week was great and I was able to finish up most of the work on the output portion of the pipeline

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
 * Work with Norton to set up a one box beta for next week
 * Create api calls for the front end and backend and implement the Queue
 * Finalize the json output, adding the correct map serialization

## Idess Lee ## 

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago):
  * Design and implement the Reader and Runner classes.
  * Ensure the unit tests for the Reader class pass, else, redesign Reader class.
  * Deploy the Rakan Runner on Docker (will need to consult with DevOps team).

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * What I did:
    * Implemented Reader class. Fixed related bugs.
    * Developed a prototype for Runner class (i.e. built method signatures, no implementation).
  * What worked:
    * Reading and loading a graph with the iowa.idx file given by the DevOps team appears successful. Nodes investigated appear as they should with expected fields.
  * What I learned:
    * Redesigning classes is a pain in the neck. Luckily, since our spec sheet was super clear from day 1, I didn't have much trouble altering pieces here and there.
      * For example, switching some argument types from C++ references to pointers.
  * Where I had trouble:
    * Endianness got the best of me. I was stumpped over a bug when using the htonl() library function because I forgot about endianness.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Implement Runner class fully.
  * Deploy the Rakan Runner on Docker (will need to consult with DevOps team).
  * Connect Runner to the Queue.

## William Castro ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

	* Develop header and .cc files for graph, nodes, and runner classes. Complete basic implementation to begin to write fully fleshed tests.
	* Finish the testsuite executable to run all tests with ease.
	* Possibly learn CMake? Depending on backend direction going further into the week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
	* Worked on Runner module, as well as helped figuring out how to get parts of the Reader module fully functioning.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
	* Upon the finishing of the runner module by tomorrow, the backend team will develop the test suite and also begin to look at code design to begin to improve our implemetation. 

## Colin Topper ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week: This week I will write providers for the APIs defined last week. Additionally I will setup the redux store so that the data from the API responses can be propogated to the UI.

* I implemented mock providers for all of the contracts defined so far. Additionally I wrote unit tests for these providers and connected them to the redux store. This involved setting up a redux store from scratch which was painful as always but is now complete (and Type safe!). There were a few API contract updates aswell but no major overhauls.

* This week I am writting a provider for the google maps API. This includes setting up billing and managing an API key. By the end of this week we should be able to draw a map of Iowa on the screen complete with precincts and districts.

## Geovani Castro ##

* Copy from last week: 
  * Outline of plans and goals for the following week:
  * Making the prototype took priority over learning JS tools, but now that progress is pretty set on the prototype I'm going to spend time learning React and Redux.
  * Going to finish up the high fidelity prototype
  * Will learn how to import the HTML/CSS from the prototype to our website

* Report on progress and issues:s
  * Made progress on the high fidelity prototype, am focused on porting over the structure to the actual website now. Its a little more complicated than I thought so I'm gonna be spending more time debugging that. Have also been learning React/Redux and that's going smoothly. I'll be diving more into Colin's structure and approach to building the front-end so I anticipate some trouble.

* Outline of plans and goals for the following week:
  * Port entire prototype over to the website
  * Work and meet with Colin often to get a good sense of how to start using Redux/React
