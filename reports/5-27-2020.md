# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * Develop debug tools for back-end

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * Back-end team abandoned edge-major redesign due to time constraints
    * But successfully redesigned C++ API to merge with Cython

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Develop debug tools for back-end
  * Write more deterministic tests in attempt to find severed district bug in back-end


## Agenda ##

* To Brendan:
  * Discuss what the final release looks like (expectations, grading criteria)
* To back-end:
  * Discuss how to visualize debugging

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

## Idess Lee ##

  * `Runner::BFS()` still needs to be fixed

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I developed deterministic tests for `Runner::BFS()`. I have determined that the BFS works as expected, even in edge cases with nodes with no neighbors, graph with no nodes, etc.
  * I learned that the bug is not in BFS, but rather elsewhere. I highly suspect it is in the `is_valid` check in the Metropolis-Hastings walk that is letting illegal redistrictings to slip by.
  * I had trouble writing deterministic tests because of the random-nature of the algorithms (such as seeding and Metropolis-Hastings). I fixed this by separating out the randomness into its own method to be called when needed.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
  * Find where bug is via tests
