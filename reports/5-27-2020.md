# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * Develop debug tools for back-end

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * Back-end team abandoned edge-major redesign due to time constraints
    * But successfully redesigned C++ API to merge with Cython

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Develop debug tools for back-end
  * Write more deterministic tests in attempt to find severed district bug in back-end


## Agenda ##

* To Brendan:
  * Discuss what the final release looks like (expectations, grading criteria)
* To back-end:
  * Discuss how to visualize debugging

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

Done:
* Making the actual development environment much more simple (no more docker-compose)
* Created boilerplate for wrappers (+ some functionality)
* POC of wrapper in an unrelated repo
* New API

Doing:

* File IO
* Tests
* Bladecaller merge
* Debugging tools for backend

## Kyle McCulloch ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

## Idess Lee ## 

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * `Runner::BFS()` still needs to be fixed

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I developed deterministic tests for `Runner::BFS()`. I have determined that the BFS works as expected, even in edge cases with nodes with no neighbors, graph with no nodes, etc.
  * I learned that the bug is not in BFS, but rather elsewhere. I highly suspect it is in the `is_valid` check in the Metropolis-Hastings walk that is letting illegal redistrictings to slip by.
  * I had trouble writing deterministic tests because of the random-nature of the algorithms (such as seeding and Metropolis-Hastings). I fixed this by separating out the randomness into its own method to be called when needed.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
  * Find where bug is via tests

## William Castro ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * By the end of the week, the graph module should be fully implemented and I should have already started to test some of its functionality to avoid surprises. Into the weekend and next week, the goal is to finish implementing all of the Graph algorithms leveraging the new graph design. Testing the engine should be our goalpost for the next week on the backend.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I updated the graph, node, and runner modules to reflect the new api changes agreed upon by the python team. This means that everything is good to go to be wrapped in python. I also was working on tests for the graph and the node implementations to ensure that none of the submodules below runner could be festering bugs.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
  * I plan to finish writing thorough tests for the graph module and hop over to help idess write runner tests to check our algorithms. Ideally, the python team will also have a debugging program up to allow us to find the BFS bug visually if it proves difficult to find the bug even after testing. This will be done over the weekend to ensure full graph functionality by release.

## Colin Topper ##

* Copy from Last week: My main priority for the upcoming week is implementing the job list on the sidebar. This feature is necessary to support several of our usecases.

* I made progress on implementing the feature. There are no unexpected technical challenges. I also worked with Norton to soldify our new contracts going forward into the final release. Unfortunately this week wasn't as productive as previous, likely the result of competing work and or general mental strain.

* For next week i need to finish mapjob list and polish the entirity of my work so far for final release.
