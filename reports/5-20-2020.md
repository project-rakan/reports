# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * Long term goal:
      * Establish a better and easier communication protocol between teams (we're scrapping `RabbitMQ`)
    * Devops plans:
      * Write a wrapper for front to back-end communication, including parsing data structures between different languages
      * Provide manpower to other teams now that devops is no longer needed
    * Front-end plans:
      * Fix aesthetics of web-app
      * Further work on implementing additional use cases, specifically one in which a user generates their own map
    * Back-end plans:
      * Highest priority: Fix BFS bug!!!!!!!!
      * Discuss dismantling Node class and implementing a dynamic-edge class
      * Debug tool deveopment
    * New Github/Development Rules
      * Branch locking
      * TDD enforced push locks (Configure github to reject all commits where there is undocumented/untested code)

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * Back-end team "merged" and discussed Git rules/formal usage.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Develop debug tools for back-end

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Develop debug tools
  * Re-factor Runner with new API and data structures 
* front-end team
  * TODO

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

* Making the actual development environment much more simple (no more docker-compose)
* Created boilerplate for wrappers
* POC of wrapper in an unrelated repo

* File IO
* Bladecaller merge
* Debugging tools for backend

## Kyle McCulloch ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * Meet with the backend team, work with them more closely for the remainder of the project
work on getting the tests/linter for the pipeline loaded into git for a CI
* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * CI testing for rakan repo is working github actions
  * Python wrapper files for the backend runner are setup, waiting for the specific header files
* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should 
  * Finish wrapper files
  * Implement github actions to prevent pushing to dev or master without passing tests

## Idess Lee ## 

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * I need to fix `Runner::BFS()` so that severed districts do not exist  
    * I plan to add additional tests to check for this invariant; HOWEVER, due to the randomness of the algorithm, I don't believe the tests will help much
  * Consult with William about a redesign of the data structures

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I realized that I cannot make significant progress in fixing the bug in `Runner::BFS()` if:
    1. We are scrapping old data structures that are used in the buggy BFS
    2. We are reimplementing new data structures to replace those discarded in 1
    3. We do not have visualization tools to help us see the actual BFS progress
  * I am stuck until the above three limitations are solved
  * The new back-end team successfully established new Git practices and I learned to use Git properly (such as branching, pull requests, issues tracker, etc.)

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.
  * `Runner::BFS()` still needs to be fixed

## William Castro ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.
  * I plan to work with Idess to redesign the graph from node-major to edge-major, as well as begin implemented the updated algorithms using this design. Also, I plan to work on the test suite as well as we continue to work through backend changes (Definitely update the test suite for the graph to make it more extensive).

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I am currently working through reimplementing the graph into an edge-major design. I have also been defining API contracts between the C++ engines and the Python side of the backend, as well as creating an edge module to work inside of the graph. I also learned more about git practices and became accustomed to working with new git functionality such as git issues and pull requests. I had trouble with knowing what the main team direction was in the changes that we wanted to make in the graph, however talking through the API contracts with the other team members was definitely very helpful for giving the redesign better direction.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
  * By the end of the week, the graph module should be fully implemented and I should have already started to test some of its functionality to avoid surprises. Into the weekend and next week, the goal is to finish implementing all of the Graph algorithms leveraging the new graph design. Testing the engine should be our goalpost for the next week on the backend.

## Geovani Castro ##

* Will follow more tutorials on Redux and React, start learning how to implement the custom redistricting page.

* Made progress on cleaning up the beta release as Colin and I shifted our focus to that instead of implementing the custom redistricting page.

* Implement custom redistricting page or whatever Colin thinks is necessart to implement next.
