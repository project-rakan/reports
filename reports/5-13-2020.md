# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago).
  * Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet
  * Notable team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready (due 5/1)

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * Each team accomplished their respective tasks for beta release! Yay
  * Back-end and front-end are finally able to communicate to each other (albeit through last-minute changes)
  * Teams struggled to use Docker (except for dev-ops)
    * This was expected as we documented Docker as a major risk in our risk assessment

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine.
  * Long term goal:
    * Establish a better and easier communication protocol between teams (we're scrapping `RabbitMQ`)
  * Devops plans:
    * Write a wrapper for front to back-end communication, including parsing data structures between different languages
    * Provide manpower to other teams now that devops is no longer needed
  * Front-end plans:
    * Fix aesthetics of web-app
    * Further work on implementing additional use cases, specifically one in which a user generates their own map
  * Back-end plans:
    * Highest priority: Fix BFS bug!!!!!!!!
    * Discuss dismantling Node class and implementing a dynamic-edge class

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Find bug in BFS
    * Tough to do without visualization
    * Possibly need help from dev-ops team to visualize redistrictings
  * Further research into a dynamic-edge class
    * Discuss ways to improve efficiency in terms of design
* dev-ops team
  * merging into the back-end team
* front-end team
  * TODO

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

* Glued frontend + backend + queue
* Distribution database
* Prototyped a better queue + API

## Kyle McCulloch ##

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

## Idess Lee ## 

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago).
  * Implement Runner class fully.
  * Deploy the Rakan Runner on Docker (will need to consult with DevOps team).
  * Connect Runner to the Queue.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * Runner class is complete and connected to the Queue! (Sad to see it get scrapped)
    * However, as documented above, a major bug exists in `Runner::BFS()`
  * I learned a little tiny bit about `cmake` after using it to build
    * I am stuck on getting the build to work on GitHub's CI, the build currently works only on local machines
  * As many of my other team members, I had trouble using `Docker` and had to consult manager Norton for instructions

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine.
  * I need to fix `Runner::BFS()` so that severed districts do not exist
    * I plan to add additional tests to check for this invariant; HOWEVER, due to the randomness of the algorithm, I don't believe the tests will help much
  * Consult with William about a redesign of the data structures
