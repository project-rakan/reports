# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

- Copy from last week:
  - [x] Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet
  - [x] Notable team deadline: April 29th, devops hands off files to backend + frontend
  - [x] Docker scripts for each team (provided by devops team)
    - [x] Requires cross communications
  - [x] Contact Christopher
- This week:
  - [ ] Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet
  - [ ] Notable team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready (due 5/1)

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Implement Graph, Node, Reader, and Runner classes
  * Ensure such implementation still passes unit tests
* dev-ops team
  - [x] Figuring out a way to fix multi-polygons
  - [ ] Figuring out a way to fix polygons that aren't connected to anything
  - [x] Sourcing Demographic information for Iowa, Washington
  - [x] Complete pipeline for IA GIS files
* front-end team
  * Determine ownership of google API account
  * Prototype and minimum functionality feedback 

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra ##

- [x] Created a multi-map merge algorithm + redistribution of population demographics application
- [x] Passed off the output to Kyle
- [x] Quick deployment script of queue + health monitor
- [ ] Setup an API for frontend to ping

## Kyle McCulloch ##

- [x] Took Norton's output and converted it to an .idx file for backend to use

* Exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It can be empty for the first week.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion.

## Idess Lee ## 

* Goals from last week:
  * Discuss edge cases
  * Implement unit tests

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I implemented unit tests for the Reader class and the utilities for the class (such as reading
  the checksum and converting from little endian to big endian byte order).
  * William and I discussed the design of the Graph model.
  * Google Test did not work once I pushed my changes to GitHub. I am sure I am misusing the framework, because it works on my local machine, but fails on GitHub.
  * I learned that RAM caching is not as efficient on Docker as it is on a single machine. I realized that attempting to cache the Graphs loaded by the Reader class in an array does not work well on Docker, because Docker can spin up multiple containers of our engine, and none of these containers share the same in-memory cache.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Design and implement the Reader and Runner classes.
  * Ensure the unit tests for the Reader class pass, else, redesign Reader class.
  * Deploy the Rakan Runner on Docker (will need to consult with DevOps team).

## William Castro ##

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Think about cases for breaking out graphical model, as well as become up to date with process that are planned to be utilized for the backend and how they interact with the rest of the system.
  * Learn C++ further in depth, as I am currently in the process of developing good foothold on the language features.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I continued to learn C++, as well as completed outlined unit tests for the graph, and nodes. Worked with partner to redesign class structure, doing away with the Edge class target and also adding a Runner class that will help us modularize the code better.
  * Learned about Google Tests to become knowledgable about testing infrastructure.
  * More housekeeping tasks like creating a Makefile to streamline development. 
  * Issues: need to understand the implementation of our caching design template better to visualize how shared data between multiple images of our backend engine will function

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
  * Develop header and .cc files for graph, nodes, and runner classes. Complete basic implementation to begin to write fully fleshed tests.
  * Finish the testsuite executable to run all tests with ease.
  * Possibly learn CMake? Depending on backend direction going further into the week. 

## Colin Topper ##

* Copy from last week: This coming week I will define all API contracts with the other subteams. If time permits, I will begin writing front-end mocks for these APIs. 

* All API contracts between frontend and other teams have been defined and commited. I additionally identified the Map API we will use (Google) and finalized the System Architecture and Design of the Frontend. Current block: who's acount & billing information should be used for google maps API?

* This week I will write providers for the APIs defined last week. Additionally I will setup the redux store so that the data from the API responses can be propogated to the UI.

## Geovani Castro ##

* Copy from last week: 

  * Going to get a clear idea of what technologies I'm definitively going to have to learn. Will continue following some more Node.js tutorials and settle on an application for prototyping that allows me to import the CSS/HTML for use alongside the Bootstrapped website. This will happen throughout the course of the next week.

* Report on progress and issues:

  * I was assigned the role of making the prototype, so I am currently working on finishing up the lofi which I will have ready for tomorrow (Thursday, April 30th)'s meeting with Brendan. It was a little challenging because it required understanding the project far better than I had at this same time last week, but I figured it out after some discussion with teammates. I learned more about using Adobe XD. Not really stuck on anything currently, progress is smooth. 

* Outline of plans and goals for the following week:
  * Making the prototype took priority over learning JS tools, but now that progress is pretty set on the prototype I'm going to spend time learning React and Redux.
  * Going to finish up the high fidelity prototype
  * Will learn how to import the HTML/CSS from the prototype to our website
