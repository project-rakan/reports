# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

- Copy from last week:
  - Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet.
  - Notable team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready
  - Docker scripts for each team (provided by devops team)
    - Requires cross communications
  - Contact Christopher

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. This subsection should be higher-level than individual contributions and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it's good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.*

## Colin Topper ##

* Copy from last week: This coming week I will define all API contracts with the other subteams. If time permits, I will begin writing front-end mocks for these APIs. 

* All API contracts between frontend and other teams have been defined and commited. I additionally identified the Map API we will use (Google) and finalized the System Architecture and Design of the Frontend. Current block: who's acount & billing information should be used for google maps API?

* This week I will write providers for the APIs defined last week. Additionally I will setup the redux store so that the data from the API responses can be propogated to the UI.
