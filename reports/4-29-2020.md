# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

- Copy from last week:
  - Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet.
  - Notable team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready
  - Docker scripts for each team (provided by devops team)
    - Requires cross communications
  - Contact Christopher

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. This subsection should be higher-level than individual contributions and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it's good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.*

## William Castro ##

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Think about cases for breaking out graphical model, as well as become up to date with process that are planned to be utilized for the backend and how they interact with the rest of the system.
  * Learn C++ further in depth, as I am currently in the process of developing good foothold on the language features.

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.
  * I continued to learn C++, as well as completed outlined unit tests for the graph, and nodes. Worked with partner to redesign class structure, doing away with the Edge class target and also adding a Runner class that will help us modularize the code better.
  * Learned about Google Tests to become knowledgable about testing infrastructure.
  * More housekeeping tasks like creating a Makefile to streamline development. 
  * Issues: need to understand the implementation of our caching design template better to visualize how shared data between multiple images of our backend engine will function

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. 
  * Develop header and .cc files for graph, nodes, and runner classes. Complete basic implementation to begin to write fully fleshed tests.
  * Finish the testsuite executable to run all tests with ease.
  * Possibly learn CMake? Depending on backend direction going further into the week. 

## Colin Topper ##

* Copy from last week: This coming week I will define all API contracts with the other subteams. If time permits, I will begin writing front-end mocks for these APIs. 

* All API contracts between frontend and other teams have been defined and commited. I additionally identified the Map API we will use (Google) and finalized the System Architecture and Design of the Frontend. Current block: who's acount & billing information should be used for google maps API?

* This week I will write providers for the APIs defined last week. Additionally I will setup the redux store so that the data from the API responses can be propogated to the UI.
