# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

- What we've done so far:
  - Established deadlines for mocks
  - Established deadlines for APIs between each subteam
  - Github + Github Logistics
  - Boilerplate code
- What needs to be done for this week:
  - Each team has their own deadlines that they are to meet.
  - Notable team deadline: Queue and health monitor deployment scripts must be ready
  - Docker scripts for each team (provided by devops team)
    - Requires cross communications
  - Contact Christopher

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Implement unit tests for graph model
* dev-ops team
  * Complete pipeline so that it works with Iowa
* front-end team
  * Go over repo policies and design
  * Connect with Christopher (Client) to enable prototyping

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra/Kyle McCulloch ##

* What we've done:
  * Cleaned GIS files for Iowa
  * Cleaned GIS files for Washington
  * A ton of READMEs
  * Docker setup the project
  * Submitted our TODOs as issues to the repo
* What we're doing/this week's todos:
  * Figuring out a way to fix multi-polygons
  * Figuring out a way to fix polygons that aren't connected to anything
  * Sourcing Demographic information for Iowa, Washington
  * Complete pipeline for IA/WA GIS files
* Longer-ish Term Goals:
  * Create a process to clean GIS files for all states
  * Finish Pipeline from census data(GIS) to usable files for the backend and frontend teams (.idx, .json)
  * Create single deployment script (since we've taken a linux-y approach)
* Trouble:
  * Learning curve for GeoPandas
  * Finding the best way to deal with edge cases

## Idess Lee ## 

* Report on progress and issues:
  * I laid out a rough schedule for the back-end team to follow.
  * I learned that the timeline is actually tighter than I expected, so the back-end team must begin establishing a concrete design for the graph model as soon as possible.
  * I had trouble coming up with edge cases on which our graph model can break, so I will need to consult with my teammates on that.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week:
  * Discuss edge cases
  * Implement unit tests

## William Castro ##

* N/A

* Report on progress and issues: 
  * I met and worked with backend partner as well as rest of the team to give input on outlining the
    rough schedule for the backend work.
  * Also began to see how timeline is shorter than I had expected, so I will work on developing unit tests
    and brushing up on any lacking technical skills to be able to contibute efficiently.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week.
  * Think about cases for breaking out graphical model, as well as become up to date with process that
    are planned to be utilized for the backend and how they interact with the rest of the system.
  * Learn C++ further in depth, as I am currently in the process of developing a good foothold on the
    language features.

## Colin Topper ##

* N/A

* I set up the github repository for the front end. This includes bootstrap code as well as code quality tools and linting. I decided to go full CI and the repo will lint and test on commit in addition to linting, testing and building on pull requests and merges to both master and dev branches. Additionally I got the front-end project boards set up and initialized an issue list in the Repo to guide future development. 

* This coming week I will define all API contracts with the other subteams. If time permits, I will begin writing front-end mocks for these APIs. 

## Geovani Castro ##

* N/A

* Learned a bit about Node.js and refamiliarized myself with Javascript. Started researching some of the different ways that I could prototype the app and start coming up with some deisgns. Learned more about the overall scope of the project and got a better understanding of the backend so that when it comes to implementing the front I'll know what to do. Not really sure what parts of the Javascript I'm going to be using exactly and we're using a lot of technologies that I'm unfamiliar with so need to adjust to that.

* Going to get a clear idea of what technologies I'm definitively going to have to learn. Will continue following some more Node.js tutorials and settle on an application for prototyping that allows me to import the CSS/HTML for use alongside the Bootstrapped website. This will happen throughout the course of the next week.
