# Team report #
(status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

* N/A

* Report on progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week. Bullet points are fine. If tasks from one week aren't yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with an updated estimate for time to completion. this subsection should be higher-level than individual contributions and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it's good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.*

## Agenda ##

* back-end team
  * Implement unit tests for graph model
* dev-ops team
  * Complete pipeline so that it works with Iowa
* front-end team
  * Go over repo policies and design
  * Connect with Christopher (Client) to enable prototyping

# Contributions of individual team members. #

## Norton Pengra/Kyle McCulloch ##

* What we've done:
  * Cleaned GIS files for Iowa
  * Cleaned GIS files for Washington
  * A ton of READMEs
  * Docker setup the project
  * Submitted our TODOs as issues to the repo
* What we're doing/this week's todos:
  * Figuring out a way to fix multi-polygons
  * Figuring out a way to fix polygons that aren't connected to anything
  * Sourcing Demographic information for Iowa, Washington
  * Complete pipeline for IA/WA GIS files
* Longer-ish Term Goals:
  * Create a process to clean GIS files for all states
  * Finish Pipeline from census data(GIS) to usable files for the backend and frontend teams (.idx, .json)
  * Create single deployment script (since we've taken a linux-y approach)
* Trouble:
  * Learning curve for GeoPandas
  * Finding the best way to deal with edge cases

## Idess Lee ## 

* Report on progress and issues:
  * I laid out a rough schedule for the back-end team to follow.
  * I learned that the timeline is actually tighter than I expected, so the back-end team must begin establishing a concrete design for the graph model as soon as possible.
  * I had trouble coming up with edge cases on which our graph model can break, so I will need to consult with my teammates on that.

* Outline your plans and goals for the following week:
  * Discuss edge cases
  * Implement unit tests

## Colin Topper ##

* N/A

* I set up the github repository for the front end. This includes bootstrap code as well as code quality tools and linting. I decided to go full CI and the repo will lint and test on commit in addition to linting, testing and building on pull requests and merges to both master and dev branches. Additionally I got the front-end project boards set up and initialized an issue list in the Repo to guide future development. 

* This coming week I will define all API contracts with the other subteams. If time permits, I will begin writing front-end mocks for these APIs.
